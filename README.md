# File Inventory
Toy project to give an inventory of files across various sources with goals of:
- Knowing contents of backups
- Finding files without a backup
- Finding duplicate files
- Finding and removing unneeded files
- Ensuring data integrity of files (via md5 checksums)

I built this project so I could learn go, and it could have some utlility for others if they are comfortable building this project and working in the command line and working directly with a database.
